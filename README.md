Welcome to SACH or the SAC Helper. This code was developed for GEOL 395 - a special topics class in which 
we use SAC to examine binary files containing seismic data. The following functions are used to help with 
the process of taking seismic binary data and performing Fourier Transformations to reveal a Rayleigh 
Dispersion Curve.

All of this code is free and publicly available for anyone to use.

Development and documentation are underway.
